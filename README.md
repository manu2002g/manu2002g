## Hi there, I'm Manusha ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I'm a recent graduate from the [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/)'s Bachelor of Computing (Honours) Computer Science programme.  I did a focus area in AI as well as a minor in Economics. I'm curious and a quick learner, and I like building things.

## Skills

I am comfortable with Java, JavaScript (React, Express.js), Python, and C++. I also have had experience using AWS tools such as S3, Lambda and EKS.
